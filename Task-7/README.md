📌 What is SPECKit Plus?

SPECKit Plus is an AI-Native project development framework that guides students from an idea to a fully implemented solution. It provides a structured workflow with five phases—Constitution, Specify, Plan, Tasks, and Implement—making project development organized, clear, and professional.

🧩 Core Concepts

1️⃣ Constitution (/constitution)

Defines the project’s foundation: purpose, goals, and vision. It answers what the project is and why it matters.

2️⃣ Specify (/specify)

Documents the detailed project requirements, features, and user needs. Converts ideas into clear specifications.

3️⃣ Plan (/plan)

Designs how the project will be completed. Includes timelines, workflows, and strategy to keep development on track.

4️⃣ Tasks (/tasks)

Breaks the plan into small, manageable tasks with clear instructions and acceptance criteria.

5️⃣ Implement (/implement)

The coding and development phase where the actual project is built, tested, and finalized.
